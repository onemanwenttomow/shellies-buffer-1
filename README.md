## ASYNC and AWAIT

- Another refresher on Async and Fetch would be helpful. Thank you.

- Async functions and how a promise works. (ideally with use cases)

- Another recap on setTimeOut and sleep function would be very helpful.

## Callback Functions

- Could you explain one more time on inserting a function into another function?

- Could you please give us examples that help us instantly see the different between named function and anonymous function.

```js
// Write a function named waitThenRun that takes another function as an argument. It should wait 1.5 seconds and then run the function that was passed in.

waitThenRun(function () {
  console.log("Hello!");
}); // logs 'Hello!' 1.5 seconds later
```

## Loops

- I don't quite understand when or how to use different type of loops. Could you explain with use cases ? Thank you.

- How to make multiple addEventListener codes into function, to make the code easier to read.

- best practices on how concise code should be (maybe that's for later as well) what's too verbose, what's too little

- hey fully understood how to properly use two similar operators: == and === . I do not have a complete sense of understanding, for example: if the task says that something needs to be done but does not say in what specific way or a more detailed explanation, then sometimes it is difficult, but then when we analyze it with the coach, it turns out to be easy and simple But of course it is implemented by trial and error, but I am sure that it should come with time

- I'm not good at topics like JS Objects & Arrays, JS Array Methods, JS Async Functions.
